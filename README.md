# Repository of my accepted python3 answers to various leetcode.com problems

Storing these here mostly to have a record of how I solved various problems.  Accepted answers will be marked with a relative speed and memory usage.  

I'm also going to store unaccepted answers (i.e. timeouts) that need additional work.
